<h3>Services & Dependency Injection</h3>
<p>A core feature of Angular which makes it really easy for you to have your different pieces of your app communicate with each other, to centralize code and to manage the state of your application.</p>

<h3>Observables</h3>
<p>Something which will make more sense once you've been through the routing section. It is a concept allowing you to work with asyncronous code.</p>

<h3>Pipes</h3>
<p>Another nice feature which makes it easy for you to transform the output(what you display on the template at runtime).</p>

<h3>Http</h3>
<p>Angular cant connect to a database directly, but it can connect to a server which is able to and the Http section shows just that.</p>

## TypeScript

<h4>TypeScript => More features than Vanila JS (e.g. Types, Classes, Interface, etc)</h4>
<h4>Generally though, TypeScript is an addition to Javascript; not a complete replacement, so a lot of the commands will look really familiar.</h4>

### App Module

<h4>Angular uses components to build web pages and uses modules to basically bundle different pieces, for example components of your app into packages.</h4>

### Module

<h4>Bundle of functionalities of our app and it basically gives Angular the information which features does my app have and use. </h4>

<h5>Note : App , only have one module , hence representing our complete app.</h5>
